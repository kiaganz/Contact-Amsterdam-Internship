We made two different tests, the same picture in original with high resolution and in black and white trying to give greater clarity
between the two colors, in practice eliminated some shade.

The color image has given a clearly superior result and probably, also thanks to the difference nuances, it is possible to observe in the engrave, an exellent quality of the shadow and therefore of the depth.

Setting for playwood 3mm:

Engrave mode; Speed 60, Power 100, PPI 900.


 -> *Stamp from a vectorial image.

The characters are full.

Setting for stamrobber 2mm:

Stamp mode; Mirror and Inverse the image to engrave ouside the stamp.

Speed 20, Power 100, PPI 900 -> for the engrave;

Speed 1.2, Power 100, PPI 910 -> for the cutting;

Stamp adjusting bar to choose th deeper of stamp.


# PLOTTER (Expert Pro)

Stikers from the same picture work on illustrator.

From picture to vectorialized image:

Image trace -> Expand -> vector -> ungroup -> delate the part on the image that you don't want.

For a perfect sticker after cut, if you prefer, it is possible to take off the vinyl part that you don't need and cover the sticker with tranfer tape and lay and flatten it well with something plane and rigid like any kind of plastic card.


# 3d PRINTER

Save the file as STL, open it in Cura and setting the values and save it on the SD card.

file -> Stamp

file -> Buttom stamp

# FINAL PROJECT FOR INTERNSHIP

For the final project i would like to develop a composite material starting from metal materials and to do that i would like to use waste materials also organic.

For [FABRICADEMY](../https://textile-academy.org/) final project i already did a small research about metals:

I also did a tour in the makerspace asking to any company which kind of materials they use and which waste they produce.

Essentialy, it's easy to find a lot af wood that, for the moment, it seems not be a usefull material for my project.

Apart from this, plexiglass, cardboard, pallet, polystirene from packaging, electronic board, bubble plastic.

## EXPERIMENT WITH RHINO

Trying to develope a new garment bye rhino, i had in mind to create a sort of cape with arms that extend along the body
and connected one to the other bye wires and inserted into a collar. 

What i found is that the curves, being developed in three dimension, cannot be extruded unless to create a base to which to develop the extrusion along the curve.

Once i understood this and after a lot of changes and tests, the question that arose was: how to develop it?

Even printing it, many bridges of support would have had to be created, the work is not impossible just becouse being an exercise and not being able to print such a long arms, i simply decided to change exercise considering this more than a failure, a test that taught something.

file -> exe2.rhino

The collar.

The arms and the holes for wire.

When i understood that it was necessary to move the curve base the curves of the body, i modifided it but creating curves developed in threedimension.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/exe2/exe.rhino2D.jpg?raw=true)

One of the four curves was in one dimension and it possible to see the desired effect.

## DIFFERENT KIND OF WASTE IN AMSTERDAM

After a research of what kind of waste there may inside the makerspace, a research was carrid out on the type of waste that can be found in Amsterdam or in any case in Netherlands.

Starting from idea of being able to use the bamboo as a very ductile natural elementthat is grown in Netherlands, research has also been carried out of the coltivation of bamboo.

-> In the makerspace:

A lot palywood or wood, some plasic or plexiglass, cardboard, foam and bubble plastic from packaging, electronic board, leather, yarn, paper.

-> Country:

### Zerowaste 
project recycling different kind of waste and in collaboration with the shop in the neighborhood, the waste is paying with coins that allow discount at partecipate establishment.

In addiction some artisans and artist are partner and sometimes they made product trhough waste recycling.

For example

* CULTURE COLLECTIVE BY NOMI -> http://www.culturecollectivebynomi.com/  

* EKO PLAZA


### Plastic Whale 
is an orgnaizzation and their mission is to clean the canal for a cleaner sea.

-> https://plasticwhale.com/

They also used the palstic waste to develop product and the entire space is developped in collboration with LAMA, an interior design studio specialized in innovative materials.

-> https://lamaconcept.nl/


### Metal recycling service 

in Amsterdam is [Metallic Recycle Center](../http://www.metalrecyclingcentre.nl/) and [Kaptijn Metaal Recycling](../https://www.kapteijn-oudmetaal.nl/).


### Looking for adhesives

Good site with the explanation about properties and uses of many natural glue. (in Italian)

## Cellulose research

A really interesting studied and tests with microbial cellulose.

## Pattern1

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/pattern1/pattern1.jpg?raw=true)

I started from close curves then the surfacebut if I extrude the surface from the point i will obtain pyramid.
So I need to create other shapes with scale and place them in diffrent height level and then LOFT them.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/pattern1/pattern1A.jpg?raw=true)

For a close loft I need also have point, the shape in scale and the point are placed in the center follow the development of the surface.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/pattern1/pattern1B_punti.jpg?raw=true)

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/pattern1/pattern1C_scale.jpg?raw=true)

Any shape is collocated in differetn layers to work more easily and faster when i'll move it to obtain a three-dimensional shape.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/pattern1/pattern1F.jpg?raw=true>)

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/pattern1/pattern1F_ps.jpg?raw=true)

### Result:

The milling machine pierces from top to bottom and moving in various direction on the plane.

It is not possible with this technology obtain the belly desired on the shapes, unless cut at he heigh of the belly and get two pieces to join later.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/pattern1/pattern1_problem.jpg?raw=true)

Having in mind to obtain in part, even its negative, it would thus obtain four part to do in different times and have to unite.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/pattern1/pattern1_considerazioni.jpg?raw=true)

The alternatives are: 

_ Modifing the pattern eliminated the belly and make the two molds with the milling machine.

_ Change the technology to be adopted considering the 3d printer or lasercutter with the engravings but the thickness of the pattern is exessive.


### Test with 3d printer

I create i new file with some pieces from the smaller to bigger one and developed a piece to printer.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/pattern1/3d%20printer/pattern1G_ps.jpg?raw=true)

I wanted to gave to the shapes a thicknes, i start scale and join togheter the pieces but not only the process was long at the end i discover that was not necessary.

I needed to create a plane on where printer the shapes and working on it I found a simple way to obtain a full shape and the plane immediatly.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/pattern1/3d%20printer/patter1_TESTprint.jpg?raw=true)

_Infill 40; _Layer heigh 0,16. _Time 1h 17'.

From this test is clear that the smaller pieces must be eliminated, and the geometries must be lowered.

Even at the base of the negative part i have to leave more margin.

In general i don't consider this technology very useful due to the fact that the working times and it woul need at least four times at the maximum size of the printer plate.

The test is 3,5 cm square in size and the printer plate is 20 cm per 24 cm.


### Test with Milling machine

I made another file cutting away the part under the belly, for the reasons above descripted.

In this way I also slightly lowered the geometries in general and also worked on the particularly large shape, as not to have an exaggerated height.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/pattern1/CNC/pattern1G_testCNC.jpg?raw=true)

During the process we met some difficulties.

Is important to open the file in STL model, and setting the milling machine fist for "roughing" and then for "finishing" to obtain a good resolution ofthe mold.

The material choosen is foam, and after the first phase, i lost the starting point and restart the machine for the finishing.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/pattern1/CNC/mold1_CNCtest1.jpg?raw=true)

I want to make another test considering that is necessary for me to have a border around the mold and trying to create a top which it could be possible make the stamp with my composite material.





## Test on Contact's metal waste

At home i decided to make some tests with acid natural elements that is easier find in kitchen and also to see what happen or if something happens if i get a piece of dry bamboo in hot water.

I want to see which kind of pattern is possible to obtain with the natural corrosion of th metal.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/metallo/test-metallo.jpg?raw=true)


 -> LIME
 
After 1 hour the lime has already affected the metal surface, i pull it out and left it in the air to see any changes and next day was possible to see the rust-colored areas has been created.
 
Another piece i placed upside down and after a few hours the blue was totally faded, even in this case, left to air all night long it showed , even less, halos of differetn colors from blue to orange.

The ring left all night has lost its color where was in contact with the lemon juice which after the night is colored and sticky.

It could be the effect of chemicals agents potentially used to protect the metal surface.

 -> SALT
 
![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/metallo/Metal_Salt.jpg?raw=true)


 -> VINEGAR
 
As for the lime the vinegar immediatly corroded the surface.
 
![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/metallo/Metal_Vinegar.jpg?raw=true)


 -> BAMBOO
 
After almost a day soaked in water, initially very hot, it clearly show the sign of the watere level but the consistency has not changed at all. Still boiled water, day 2.
