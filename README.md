# Day1 
## RHINO EXERCISE, TOOLS:

Revolve, offset, arraypolar, array, join, bolean difference, loft, cap.

-> Wine glass

# Day2
## LUSERCUTTER (LaserPro)

Engrave pic, no work on it, just uploaded it on illutrator connected with the machine.

We made two different tests, the same picture in original with high resolution and in black and white trying to give greater clarity
between the two colors, in practice eliminated some shade.

The color image has given a clearly superior result and probably, also thanks to the difference nuances, it is possible to observe in the engrave, an exellent quality of the shadow and therefore of the depth.

Setting for playwood 3mm:

Engrave mode; Speed 60, Power 100, PPI 900.

## PLOTTER (Expert Pro)

Stikers from the same picture work on illustrator.

From picture to vectorialized image:

Image trace -> Expand -> vector -> ungroup -> delate the part on the image that you don't want.

For a perfect sticker after cut, if you prefer, it is possible to take off the vinyl part that you don't need and cover the sticker with tranfer tape and lay and flatten it well with something plane and rigid like any kind of plastic card.

# Day 3
## LUSERCUTTER 

Stamp from a vectorial image.

The characters are full.

Setting for stamrobber 2mm:

Stamp mode; Mirror and Inverse the image to engrave ouside the stamp.

Speed 20, Power 100, PPI 900 -> for the engrave;

Speed 1.2, Power 100, PPI 910 -> for the cutting;

Stamp adjusting bar to choose th deeper of stamp.


# Week 2
## 3d PRINTER

Save the file as STL, open it in Cura and setting the values and save it on the SD card.
