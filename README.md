# Contact-Amsterdam-Internship June/August 2019
such experiments and tests with different machines and programms. Contact makerspace

# Day1 
## RHINO EXERCISE, TOOLS:

Revolve, offset, arraypolar, array, join, bolean difference, loft, cap.

file -> Wine glass

# Day2
## LUSERCUTTER (LaserPro)

Engrave pic, no work on it, just uploaded it on illutrator connected with the machine.

We made two different tests, the same picture in original with high resolution and in black and white trying to give greater clarity
between the two colors, in practice eliminated some shade.

The color image has given a clearly superior result and probably, also thanks to the difference nuances, it is possible to observe in the engrave, an exellent quality of the shadow and therefore of the depth.

Setting for playwood 3mm:

Engrave mode; Speed 60, Power 100, PPI 900.

## PLOTTER (Expert Pro)

Stikers from the same picture work on illustrator.

From picture to vectorialized image:

Image trace -> Expand -> vector -> ungroup -> delate the part on the image that you don't want.

For a perfect sticker after cut, if you prefer, it is possible to take off the vinyl part that you don't need and cover the sticker with tranfer tape and lay and flatten it well with something plane and rigid like any kind of plastic card.

# Day 3
## LUSERCUTTER 

Stamp from a vectorial image.

The characters are full.

Setting for stamrobber 2mm:

Stamp mode; Mirror and Inverse the image to engrave ouside the stamp.

Speed 20, Power 100, PPI 900 -> for the engrave;

Speed 1.2, Power 100, PPI 910 -> for the cutting;

Stamp adjusting bar to choose th deeper of stamp.


# Week 2
## 3d PRINTER

Save the file as STL, open it in Cura and setting the values and save it on the SD card.

file -> Stamp

file -> Buttom stamp

### WASTE METALLIC MATERIAL IN MAKERSAPCE

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/final%20project/waste-metallic-material.jpg?raw=true)

I also did a tour in the makerspace asking to any company which kind of materials they use and which waste they produce.

Essentialy, it's easy to find a lot af wood that, for the moment, it seems not be a usefull material for my project.

Apart from this, plexiglass, cardboard, pallet, polystirene from packaging, electronic board, bubble plastic.


# Week 3

Trying to develope a new garment bye rhino, i had in mind to create a sort of cape with arms that extend along the body
and connected one to the other bye wires and inserted into a collar. 

What i found is that the curves, being developed in three dimension, cannot be extruded unless to create a base to which to develop the extrusion along the curve.

Once i understood this and after a lot of changes and tests, the question that arose was: how to develop it?

Even printing it, many bridges of support would have had to be created, the work is not impossible just becouse being an exercise and not being able to print such a long arms, i simply decided to change exercise considering this more than a failure, a test that taught something.

file -> exe2.rhino

The collar.

The arms and the holes for wire.

When i understood that it was necessary to move the curve base the curves of the body, i modifided it but creating curves developed in threedimension.

![alt text](https://github.com/kiaganz/Contact-Amsterdam-Internship/blob/master/imagine/exe2/exe.rhino2D.jpg?raw=true)

One of the four curves was in one dimension and it possible to see the desired effect.

# week 4

After a research of what kind of waste there may inside the makerspace, a research was carrid out on the type of waste that can be found in Amsterdam or in any case in Netherlands.

Starting from idea of being able to use the bamboo as a very ductile natural elementthat is grown in Netherlands, research has also been carried out of the coltivation of bamboo.

-> In the makerspace:

A lot palywood or wood, some plasic or plexiglass, cardboard, foam and bubble plastic from packaging, electronic board, leather, yarn, paper.

-> Country:

### Zerowaste 
project recycling different kind of waste and in collaboration with the shop in the neighborhood, the waste is paying with coins that allow discount at partecipate establishment.

In addiction some artisans and artist are partner and sometimes they made product trhough waste recycling.

For example

* CULTURE COLLECTIVE BY NOMI -> http://www.culturecollectivebynomi.com/  

* EKO PLAZA


### Plastic Whale 
is an orgnaizzation and their mission is to clean the canal for a cleaner sea.

They also used the palstic waste to develop product and the entire space is developped in collboration with LAMA, an interior design studio specialized in innovative materials.
