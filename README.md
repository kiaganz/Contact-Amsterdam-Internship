We made two different tests, the same picture in original with high resolution and in black and white trying to give greater clarity
between the two colors, in practice eliminated some shade.

The color image has given a clearly superior result and probably, also thanks to the difference nuances, it is possible to observe in the engrave, an exellent quality of the shadow and therefore of the depth.

PLOTTER

Stikers from the same picture work on illustrator.

From picture to vectorialized image:

Image trace -> Expand -> vector -> ungroup -> delate the part on the image that you don't want.
